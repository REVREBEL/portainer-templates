# RevRebels's Docker App Templates by Portainer

This repository hosts the official templates (**'Apps Templates'**) definitions for Portainer.

Currnetly the repo includes custom setup & configuration for files, registires and images. We've spent serious man hours researching to find the best options for software but also setup, env variables along with combadiablity to intergrate with eachother. Feel free to use whatever you need from our repo and hopefully it saves you some of leg work we've already covered. 

For more information about the template definition format and how to deploy your own templates, see the [relevant documentation section](https://documentation.portainer.io/v2.0/templates/deploy_stack/).
